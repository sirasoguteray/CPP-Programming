# Introduction to C++

### **What is the C++ Programming Language?**

C++ is a versatile, cross-platform programming language widely used to build high-performance applications.

Originally designed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** as an enhancement to the **C language**, C++ was first developed at **AT&T Bell Labs (USA)** in **1979**.

Over time, the language has undergone significant updates, including major revisions in **2011 (C++11)**, **2014 (C++14)**, **2017 (C++17)**, and **2020 (C++20)**, introducing modern features and improvements.

C++ is both **fun** and **easy to learn**!

Since C++ shares similarities with **C#** and **Java**, it allows programmers to transition seamlessly between these languages.

### **Applications of C++**

- **Game Development**
- **Operating Systems**
- **Compilers and Code Editors**
- **Database Systems and Interpreters**
- **Graphics and Multimedia Packages**
- **Network Drivers and Protocols**

### **C++ Compiler / IDE**

To start programming in **C++**, you need two essential tools:

1. **A Text Editor** â€“ For writing C++ code (e.g., Notepad).
2. **A Compiler** â€“ For converting the C++ code into machine-readable instructions (e.g., **GCC**).

Alternatively, you can use an **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**, which combines both a code editor and a compiler, making it easier to write, edit, compile, and debug code.

### **Popular IDEs for C++**

Some of the most widely used IDEs include:

- **Code::Blocks**
- **Eclipse**
- **Visual Studio**

These IDEs are **free** and support editing and debugging C++ programs efficiently.

### **Why Visual Studio?**

In this project, I will be using **Visual Studio** as my development environment. Itâ€™s a powerful, feature-rich IDE that provides great tools for **C++ development**, including debugging, IntelliSense, and code suggestions.

You can download the latest version of **Visual Studio** from:
ðŸ‘‰ https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

### **Quick Start Guide**

Letâ€™s create our first C++ program!

1. **Download and Install Visual Studio**
   - Select the **Desktop development with C++** workload during installation.
2. **Create a New Project**
   - Open **Visual Studio** and click on:
     **File > New > Project**
3. **Select a C++ Console Application**
   - Choose **Console App (C++)** and click **Next**.
4. **Write the Code**
   - Replace the template code with your first C++ program.
5. **Save and Run the Program**
   - Click **Ctrl+F5** or go to **Debug > Start Without Debugging** to run your program.

```
// myfirstprogram.cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}
```
