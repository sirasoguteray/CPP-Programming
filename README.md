# Introduction to C++

### **What is the C++ Programming Language?**

C++ is a versatile, cross-platform programming language widely used to build high-performance applications.

Originally designed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** as an enhancement to the **C language**, C++ was first developed at **AT&T Bell Labs (USA)** in **1979**.

Over time, the language has undergone significant updates, including major revisions in **2011 (C++11)**, **2014 (C++14)**, **2017 (C++17)**, and **2020 (C++20)**, introducing modern features and improvements.

C++ is both **fun** and **easy to learn**!

Since C++ shares similarities with **C#** and **Java**, it allows programmers to transition seamlessly between these languages.

### **Applications of C++**

- **Game Development**
- **Operating Systems**
- **Compilers and Code Editors**
- **Database Systems and Interpreters**
- **Graphics and Multimedia Packages**
- **Network Drivers and Protocols**

------

### **C++ Compiler / IDE**

To start programming in **C++**, you need two essential tools:

1. **A Text Editor** â€“ For writing C++ code (e.g., Notepad).
2. **A Compiler** â€“ For converting the C++ code into machine-readable instructions (e.g., **GCC**).

Alternatively, you can use an **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**, which combines both a code editor and a compiler, making it easier to write, edit, compile, and debug code.

------

### **Popular IDEs for C++**

Some of the most widely used IDEs include:

- **Code::Blocks**
- **Eclipse**
- **Visual Studio Code**

These IDEs are **free** and support editing and debugging C++ programs efficiently.

### **Why Visual Studio Code?**

In this project, I will be using **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)** as my development environment. I find it to be an excellent tool for beginners and experienced programmers alike.

You can download the latest version of **VSCode** from:
ðŸ‘‰ https://code.visualstudio.com/

### **Quick Start Guide**

Letâ€™s create our first C++ program!

1. Open **VSCode** and go to:
   **File > New Text File**
2. Write the following C++ code:
3. Save the file as:
   **myfirstprogram.cpp**
   (**File > Save As**)

`// myfirstprogram.cpp

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Hello World!";
  return 0;
}`
