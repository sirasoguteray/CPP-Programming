# Introduction to C++

### **What is the C++ Programming Language?**

C++ is a versatile, cross-platform programming language widely used to build high-performance applications.

Originally designed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** as an enhancement to the **C language**, C++ was first developed at **AT&T Bell Labs (USA)** in **1979**.

Over time, the language has undergone significant updates, including major revisions in **2011 (C++11)**, **2014 (C++14)**, **2017 (C++17)**, and **2020 (C++20)**, introducing modern features and improvements.

C++ is both **fun** and **easy to learn**!

Since C++ shares similarities with **C#** and **Java**, it allows programmers to transition seamlessly between these languages.
